# Architecture Dossier Template

This project aims at defining a markdown template of an Architecture Dossier.
Objective is to set the architecture dossier as an asset of the project relying on the developer tools.
Many advantages

-   **Focus on content** : Markdown syntax forces the author to focus more on content that colours.
-   **A development asset**: Architecture dossier is done with the same tools that the implementation.
-   **Collaboration**: Have you ever tried to collaborate on a document with revision marks ? If so, you will adore to use git to collaborate effectively on this document :smile:.
-   **Everywhere**: Publishing on git allow a rapid publication of the content anywhere, anytime in seconds.
-   **All-in-one**: Even diagrams can be scripted.

Most of the diagrams can be drawn relying on PlantUML flat file

With a little help from my friends  :

-   Helper files have bee provided in the images folder in order to generate the diagram with plantUML
-   A Excel spreadsheet is also provided in order to generate table more easily in the .md files

### Installing

Update the files, add, commit, push... et voila.

**Start here :**  [Introduction](./ArchitectureDossier/0000.Introduction.md)

## Built With

-   Any text editor can be used... Atom ?
